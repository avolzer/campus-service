# Campus Crawl Webservice

This is the data service application for Campus Crawl 
and it is deployed here:
          
<https://campus-crawl-service.herokuapp.com/>

It is based on the standard Heroku with Node.js tutorial.

<https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs>  

The database is relational with the schema specified in the `sql/` sub-directory,
 and is hosted on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/). The database user
and password are stored as Heroku configuration variables rather than in this (public) repo.
 
The Campus Crawl client repo can be found [here](github.com/calvin-cs262-fall2020-teamb/campusCrawl-client) and the project resources are [here]( github.com/calvin-cs262-fall2020-teamb/campusCrawl-project)
